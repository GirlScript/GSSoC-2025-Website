Giving Back to the Community:\nAs someone who has benefited immensely from community-driven platforms, I joined GSSoC’25 to mentor new contributors, share best practices, and help them grow both technically and personally.\n\n2. Cultivating Future Leaders:\nGuiding students through real-world projects helps them gain confidence and clarity. It’s fulfilling to watch beginners become confident coders under my mentorship.\n\n3. Strengthening Open-Source Impact:\nThrough GSSoC'24 and now GSSoC'25, I’ve had the opportunity to work on meaningful projects like Waste Management Solutions and AI-Based Capstone Initiatives, proving how collaborative code can solve real-world problems.\n\n4. Enhancing My Mentorship Skills:\nMentoring not only refines my technical understanding but also enhances my communication, leadership, and conflict-resolution abilities — vital for any tech professional.\n\n5. Creating a Ripple Effect:\nBy mentoring in programs like GSSoC, I aim to create a ripple effect of learning and contribution that goes beyond just one project or one season — but shapes the future of open-source in India and beyond.",

I enjoyed helping them troubleshoot and watching them gain confidence in building real-world tech solutions.\n\nThis mentorship experience has motivated me to take a more formal mentoring role in programs like GSSoC, where I can continue helping contributors grow and contribute meaningfully.",

I believe I can use these skills to guide contributors technically and motivate them throughout the program.\n\nGSSoC is a fantastic platform to promote real-world experience among students, and I’m excited to help create a welcoming and productive environment where contributors can learn, grow, and make impactful contributions.",

I have projects I have built while maintaining, contributing to, and actively building real-world projects and being able to help new contributors become accustomed to best practices, open-source workflows, and how to contribute and engage would be rewarding. \n\nMentorship is also not just an opportunity to help others, but it is also an opportunity to improve as a leader, reviewer, and communicator.

I have experience working with modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Git, and I want to use these skills to empower contributors to make substantial, high-quality contributions. Above all, I want to empower them to gain confidence and knowledge of open-source.\n\nI think GSSoC's not about code – it's about community.

As the Events Club Lead for my department, I’ve hosted and mentored students across three hackathons, guided my peers in daily learning, and taught juniors through the RAIOT Club at my university. Whether it's helping someone debug their first Python script or mentoring a team through their first project, I’ve found fulfillment in enabling others to grow. GSSoC feels like the ideal next step, a chance to mentor with purpose, give back to the open-source ecosystem, and help students gain the confidence and experience that once changed my own path.",

My role involved not just solving their doubts, but also helping them break down complex problems, develop logical thinking, and gain confidence while working on hands-on projects.\n\nApart from this, I have been a contributor in GSSoC earlier, which gave me first-hand experience of how open-source communities function, how to collaborate with maintainers, and how to contribute effectively through pull requests. This experience allows me to better understand the challenges that new contributors face, and how to guide them through the process.\n\nIn addition, I’ve been working as a freelancer, which has helped me improve my skills in client communication, project management, and delivering solutions on time. These experiences together have shaped me into someone who can mentor not just on the technical side, but also on communication, collaboration, and professional growth.",

Helping students overcome their doubts, build confidence, and see their first contributions get merged is something that excites me.\n\nAt the same time, mentoring gives me an opportunity to improve my leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills while learning from the fresh perspectives that contributors bring. I see this as a chance to not only support others in their journey but also to grow myself by being part of an active, collaborative open-source community.",

In this role, I was responsible for assigning tasks, reviewing code and model outputs, and ensuring team members understood complex concepts like 3D UNet architectures, GANs, and medical image preprocessing. I often conducted knowledge-sharing sessions within the team and helped others debug and optimize their models.\n\nAt IEEE SB UIET, where I currently serve as the Vice Chairperson for Women in Engineering, I have mentored juniors in areas like open-source contributions, GitHub usage, and getting started with AI/ML projects. I’ve helped organize and lead technical sessions on machine learning fundamentals, project structuring, and career guidance—especially encouraging female students to participate in tech competitions and coding events.\n\nDuring my personal projects—such as SmartNotes-AI, Vigil.ai, and AI-Powered Attendance System—I have collaborated with peers who were new to certain tools and frameworks. I took the initiative to walk them through technologies like FAISS, Hugging Face Transformers, Flask, and PyTorch, ensuring everyone was on the same page. These informal mentoring moments helped me grow as a communicator and problem-solver, and I realized how rewarding it is to support others in their learning journey.\n\nOverall, my mentorship experience combines technical depth, leadership responsibility, and a learner-first mindset—qualities I look forward to bringing to GSSoC as a mentor.",

Never thrown my leadership skills as a superiority on others rather as a collaborative skill contributing and growing TOGETHER throughout! And I guess that's the true leadership spirit when your \"leadership\" doesn't seem to be like a leadership to your team but a collaborative and optimistic approach without making others feel inferior!\n\n> Hoping and looking forward optimistically to guide others. To be honest and being straightforward without faking I may not have that much tech knowledge as I just moved to my second year of B.Tech but have a lot of leadership, team collaboration and hardworking optimistically experience and sometimes I believe it's not the tech knowledge required much more for a team project as there are people to tackle that but need a no inferior, great collaborative environment with no betrayal of opinions and ideas under a good leadership and I think I am fit for that role!",

By sharing my technical expertise, real-world project experience, and lessons from leading diverse teams, I aim to guide them in transforming curiosity into capability, and capability into lasting impact. For me, mentoring is not just about teaching—it’s about igniting a spark that drives someone’s lifelong journey in tech because for me true success is not just creating impact-but enabling others to create it too!

My mentorship efforts ranged from live workshops and code walkthroughs to hands-on debugging support and project reviews.\n\nIn addition, I served as a mentor during Web Kirti 2.0 — a 3-month-long web development initiative conducted by the AASF Club. I guided two teams through end-to-end project development using a modern tech stack that included MERN, Next.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS. I helped students design scalable architectures, implement robust APIs in Node.js and Python (Flask), and follow best practices in Git-based version control, UI/UX design, and CI/CD workflows.\n\nBeyond that, I’ve also collaborated on complex system design and deployment as part of industry-facing projects like Dermadetect (ML-powered diagnostics) and DEMon (decentralized edge networks). These experiences gave me deep insight into mentoring in high-pressure, production-grade environments.\n\nThrough each of these roles, my focus has remained consistent: to create an inclusive, supportive space where students feel empowered to experiment, learn from failure, and contribute meaningfully to tech communities — a philosophy that strongly aligns with GSSoC’s values.",

I’m particularly excited about helping first-time contributors navigate their open source journey with confidence and purpose.\n\nMore than just teaching, I see mentoring as an opportunity to learn, lead, and build meaningful connections within a growing developer community.

    "about": "Who am I? I am Sayanabha Chandra, and,\n\nIt took me more than 4 years of engineering and 1 year of real-world experience to truly understand the ins and outs of development, but since then, I've realized that the real magic happens in the designs that make users feel truly connected.\n\nI design a lot. And that doesn’t mean I spend my whole day sitting in front of the machine, working on Figma. While I might do that when deadlines are tight, what I do most of the time is think. I think a lot about potential solutions to everyday problems, and these solutions aren't just limited to software but extend to creating experiences that improve how we interact with the world around us.\n\nI’ve worked in game development, app development, and web development throughout my college life, and one thing that unites them all—like the gears of a finely tuned machine—is design. A good design is something you don't just see; you feel it. A bad design, on the other hand, is both seen and felt, and not in a good way.\n\nSo, that’s where I come in. With my experience and creativity, I elevate design thinking into practical tools that can enhance your business. I have my solid engineering background to assist me in that (I develop as well). Whether you need innovative solutions or a fresh perspective on your existing tools, I’m here to help with consultation sessions designed to take your business to the next level.\n\n(P.S. I love to participate in hackathons, cohorts, meetups etc. I like to hear what other people with similar mindset, thinks and feels.)",

I want to create a space where asking questions is celebrated, mistakes are part of growth, and learning is a shared journey.",

    "previous_experience": "While I haven’t formally held a “mentor” title yet.  I have actively taken on mentorship-like responsibilities in the open-source communities I contribute to. \nIn the Rocket.Chat community, especially during GSoC 2025, I was one of the most active contributors. As a result, many new contributors would reach out to me for guidance on setting up the project locally, understanding the codebase, and identifying beginner friendly issues. I’ve always tried to be approachable and supportive, sharing resources, debugging setups, and clarifying doubts\nIn addition to my open source work, I’ve mentored junior teams during  intra college hackathons. This included helping them choose the right tech stack, and offering guidance during problem-solving sessions. \nThese experiences have helped me naturally step into a mentoring role, and I now feel confident to formally mentor under GSSoC by guiding contributors in both technical and community aspects of open source.",

    "reason": "As an active open source contributor with a strong foundation in CNCF projects and other large scale ecosystems like Rocket.Chat(https://gsoc.rocket.chat/), I’ve experienced firsthand the transformative power of mentorship. Currently, I am a mentee at the Headlamp project under the Kubernetes SIGs via the LFX mentorship program. This experience has deepened my technical skills and helped me understand the value of guidance and community support.\n\nAdditionally, as one of the top contributors to Rocket.Chat during GSoC 2025, I’ve gained significant experience working on real world issues in production-grade systems, learning best practices in collaboration, architecture, and code quality. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical expertise but also given me insight into the kind of mentorship that empowers contributors to grow.\n\nNow, I’m eager to give back to the open source community by supporting and mentoring newcomers through GSSoC. I want to help create an inclusive and encouraging environment where contributors feel confident taking on challenges, exploring ideas, and growing their skill sets. Open source changed my trajectory, and I want to help do the same for others.",

This is why I want to mentor at GSSoC 2025—not because I have all the answers, but because I’m committed to creating a safe, collaborative, and growth-oriented environment for contributors like me.\nI strongly believe that mentorship is not a one-way transfer of knowledge, but a shared journey. While I help mentees navigate the process of understanding repositories, making PRs, and learning open-source tools, I will also be learning—sharpening my understanding, deepening my communication skills, and growing with the community.\nI have already started mentoring juniors informally, explaining concepts, setting up GitHub for them, and motivating them to take part in tech programs. Through GSSoC, I want to scale that impact and help new contributors believe that they belong in tech, no matter their background or experience level.\nOpen-source is built on collaboration, learning, and sharing—and that’s exactly what I want to foster as a GSSoC 2025 mentor.",

My responsibilities included defining project scope, breaking down complex tasks into manageable milestones, and providing one-on-one technical guidance.

I taught my team not only what to change but also why those changes were necessary, fostering a deeper understanding of clean code principles, efficiency, and scalability. This direct, hands-on approach helped the team members grow into more confident and skilled developers.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Mentoring and Onboarding: I have consistently taken the lead in training and onboarding new team members in my previous roles.

The students initially struggled with defining a clear roadmap and selecting the right tech stack. I conducted regular brainstorming sessions to help them identify feasible features, break down the project into achievable milestones, and choose technologies that suited their skill level and the project requirements.\n\nI also helped them adopt industry-standard practices such as using Git for version control, writing modular and readable code, and integrating real-time collaboration tools like Trello and GitHub Projects for task management. Throughout the mentorship, I made sure to encourage independent problem-solving while stepping in with guidance and code reviews whenever needed.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, I also emphasized the importance of documentation, user testing, and effective presentation of their project. As a result, the team not only completed the project successfully but also gained confidence in contributing to collaborative coding environments.",
