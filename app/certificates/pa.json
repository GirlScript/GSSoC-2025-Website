    "project_description": "Arkadia by Akashic Archive\n\"Where Gaming Communities Write Their Own Stories\"\n\nArkadia is an open source platform that transforms how gaming communities create and share interactive experiences. Instead of relying on external developers, communities become the creators—building custom minigames, hosting collaborative tournaments, and crafting unique gaming experiences tailored to their culture. Built on a modern stack of React 18, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with Express.js and Socket.io powering real-time backend interactions, and Discord.js v14 handling seamless bot integration across servers, all managed through pnpm workspaces in a monorepo architecture.\n\nOur Mission: Democratize game development by providing communities with intuitive tools to create, share, and play games together. From quick Discord trivia sessions to elaborate web-based tournaments, every community can build entertainment that reflects their unique identity. The platform is designed to evolve from its current Node.js 18+ foundation to include PostgreSQL and Redis for persistent data, JWT authentication, OpenAI API integration for intelligent features, and expand into React Native mobile experiences, advanced Phaser.js and WebGL gaming, comprehensive Jest testing, and Docker containerization.\n\nWhy Arkadia Matters: Gaming communities shouldn't be limited to consuming what already exists. They should have the power to create what they envision. Arkadia bridges the gap between \"I wish we had a game like...\" and \"We built exactly what we wanted,\" providing both the technical infrastructure and intuitive development tools that make community-driven game creation accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming experience.\n\nThe Vision: A world where every Discord server, gaming community, and friend group can collaboratively develop the perfect minigames for their gatherings—without needing to be professional developers. Built with the philosophy that the best games come from understanding your players, because you ARE the players.\n\n🏛️ Developed by Akashic Archive | 🌟 GSSOC 2025",

You can simply type what you ate, like \"oatmeal with almonds and honey,\" and our AI, powered by Gemini, will instantly give you all the nutritional details—calories, protein, carbs, and fat—without any fuss. To help you understand your own body, ThunderLean includes a TDEE calculator to set personalized goals, whether you're trying to lose, maintain, or gain weight. You can also see your progress at a glance on the dashboard, which shows your daily stats and a calendar to track your streak. To keep you on track, the app provides simple, AI-driven tips tailored to your specific goals.\n\nBehind the scenes, we're building this with a modern and robust tech stack. We're using React for a smooth, responsive front end, and Express.js for a powerful back end. The smart features are all possible thanks to integrating the Gemini API. This combination of a heartfelt mission and cutting-edge technology makes ThunderLean a project that's both impactful and exciting to work on.",

Since large language models like GPT-3.5 or Gemini 1.5 are already pre-trained on vast corpora, we chose to utilize their capabilities through carefully crafted zero-shot and few-shot prompts to generate resume summaries, skill recommendations, and professional language formatting. This allowed us to build a highly functional and resource-efficient solution without requiring high computational power or extensive model training.\n\nWe focused on iterative prompt design, where inputs from the user (education, skills, experience) are combined into a structured prompt that instructs the generative model to create a formal, concise resume summary. The main strategy was optimizing input instructions to yield the most humanlike and contextually appropriate output.",

Key Features\n🚀 Real-Time Multi-Participant Analysis: Tracks every visible person simultaneously, providing independent and accurate engagement scores for each.\n🧠 Advanced AI Metrics: Goes beyond simple presence detection by analyzing:\nGaze Detection: Detects if a participant is looking away from the screen (e.g., at a phone).\nDrowsiness: Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect signs of sleepiness.\nYawning: Detects yawning as a potential indicator of fatigue or disinterest.\n📊 Live Visual Feedback: Displays a clean, intuitive overlay on each participant's video tile, including:\nA colored border (Green/Yellow/Red) representing their current engagement status.\nA text label with their name, live score, and status (e.g., \"Attentive\", \"Distracted\").\n📋 Comprehensive PDF Reporting: On-demand generation of a detailed PDF report for every tracked participant, featuring summary charts and engagement timelines. A minimum of 30 seconds of tracking is required to generate a report.\n⚡ Optimized Performance: Built with a state-managed, thread-safe Python backend and a lightweight Chrome Extension to ensure a smooth, lag-free experience.",

Professionally, I’m working as a Full Stack Developer Intern at Feb Tech IT Solutions, where I’ve developed key modules like educator onboarding, payment workflows using Stripe, and Nginx-based deployments on DigitalOcean.  One of my most meaningful contributions has been to the Radical Unlearning platform — an innovative project focused on reimagining the education system. I independently handled core development tasks, including booking flows, consultant dashboards, and frontend logic to streamline user experience.  Alongside this, I’ve built projects like Electra Mart, a Dockerized e-commerce platform with admin dashboards and product management, and Infant Care Compass, which includes real-time video calling via ZegoCloud, JWT-based authentication, and role-based user flows.  With hands-on experience in GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS, and CI/CD, I’m excited to apply as a GSSoC Project Admin to help guide contributors, maintain code quality, and foster a collaborative open-source environment.",

Used React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and ML libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.\n\nMoodify: Created a mood-based music recommendation app using a CNN model trained on facial expression data. The user uploads a selfie, and based on the predicted mood, the app recommends a personalized playlist using the Spotify API.\n\nDateLock: Developed an email scheduling system that lets users schedule emails for future delivery. The backend checks for scheduled times and automatically sends emails via the Gmail API. MongoDB was used to store scheduled emails, and Node.js handled the backend logic.\n\nThese projects reflect my ability to build real-world, resume-quality web applications that combine machine learning with responsive frontend design and robust backend systems.",

However, despite these preparations, challenges arose with overall project progress and contributor engagement. Specifically, the assigned mentors often exhibited low activity levels, and a significant portion of contributors struggled with fundamental technical concepts, leading to difficulties in project setup and a tendency to focus on superficial contributions (e.g., README updates, minor bug fixes, GitHub Actions) rather than core feature development. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into the crucial impact of active mentorship and the necessity of attracting contributors with a foundational understanding of development principles. For GSSoC '25, I am committed to implementing a more robust vetting process for potential mentors and contributors, alongside enhanced onboarding and personalized technical support, to foster a truly impactful and productive project experience for 'Splitwiser'.",

It brings together two complementary projects—OpenVoiceOS and Voice Marketing Agents—into a single, unified platform.  At its core, OpenVoiceX provides all the components you need to create sophisticated conversational assistants and AI-driven telephony agents. Whether it’s powering natural voice interactions on the web, automating phone calls for marketing and customer service, or experimenting with conversational AI research, OpenVoiceX gives you full control—without relying on expensive, proprietary APIs.  The system is designed to be modular and extensible. You can integrate your preferred speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech engines. Everything runs in a self-hosted, containerized environment using Docker, making it easy to deploy on your infrastructure and maintain full data ownership.  A modern, web-based dashboard makes it possible to visually design, test, and manage your agents without writing code. For real-time voice interactions, OpenVoiceX achieves ultra-low latency pipelines, allowing conversations to flow naturally—even with mid-sentence interruptions. It also supports traditional telephony services (like Twilio or Asterisk) and web-based voice clients out of the box.  By combining a developer-first architecture with enterprise-grade features like multi-tenancy, encryption, and API key management, OpenVoiceX is not just a toolkit—it’s a full-stack solution for building production-ready voice AI applications.",

    "project_description": "Project Description – Web Cart  Web Cart is an innovative online platform designed to simplify website and application development for businesses, startups, and individuals. It acts as a digital marketplace where users can browse, purchase, and deploy pre-made websites and applications with just one click. Unlike traditional development cycles, Web Cart provides ready-to-use, customizable solutions that save time, cost, and effort.  The platform will also serve as a community-driven marketplace, enabling students, freelancers, and independent developers to upload and sell their pre-built websites and apps. This not only empowers developers to showcase their skills and earn but also ensures buyers have access to a wide variety of creative and cost-effective solutions.  Along with one-time purchases, Web Cart will offer subscription-based maintenance services, ensuring regular updates, bug fixes, and technical support for clients. Additionally, for businesses requiring tailored solutions, Web Cart will provide custom development services through its in-house team of professional developers.  By bridging the gap between ready-made templates, open-source contributions, and professional development, Web Cart aims to become a one-stop destination for entrepreneurs and companies looking to establish a strong digital presence quickly and affordably.",

Additionally, Sheraksha supports voice-activated SOS triggers for hands-free emergency activation.\n\nTechnically, Sheraksha is a full-stack web app with a clean, responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, paired with a secure backend developed in Python using the Flask framework. It manages user authentication, emergency contact management, API integrations, and alert logging. The app is accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers, ensuring help is always within reach.\n\nChallenges such as ensuring accurate location tracking and reliable message delivery were addressed through rigorous testing and the use of robust APIs. Privacy and security were prioritized through encrypted data transmission and secure user authentication.\n\nSheraksha reflects my passion as a full-stack developer, AI enthusiast, and cybersecurity advocate to create impactful solutions that improve real lives. Moving forward, I plan to enhance Sheraksha with features like integration with emergency services, AI-driven threat detection, and wearable device compatibility to make safety even more accessible and proactive.",

    "project_description": "Discord.py Masterclass is a comprehensive, multi-page online tutorial designed to teach you how to build Discord bots using the discord.py library, step-by-step.\n\nIt starts from the very beginning: installing Python (version 3.8 or higher), setting up your development environment, configuring a Discord application and bot account, and enabling required intents like message content and server members.\n\nProgresses through fundamental concepts: connecting to events, sending messages, prefix-based commands versus hybrid (text + slash) commands, and organizing code with Cogs.\n\nIt covers intermediate to advanced features:\n\nHybrid Commands – commands that work both as prefix and slash commands.\n\nSlash Commands, including usage and restriction options like guild_only.\n\nViews and UI components (buttons, pagination) along with an embedded multi‑page help system using reactions or the modern UI views system.\n\nAdditional utilities: Custom Context, Error Handling, Argument Converters, Embeds, Checks, Background Tasks, ANSI/Markdown formatting, and even Audio Playback capabilities.\n\nA dedicated Examples section includes ready‑to‑run demos like paginated help commands, cogs structure, and more.\n\nThe goal is to extend this guide and add support and showcase more features, and refine a few existing ones, and also add cookbook style examples integrating discord with multiple other applications or sdks. Few such examples include Oauth based dashboard, different DBs, LLMs+MCP, Agentic Workflows, Sharding etc.",

The system enables farmers to list fresh produce, dairy, and other agricultural goods, while consumers can browse, order, and receive deliveries straight from the source.\n\nBy integrating features such as real-time inventory updates, secure payment gateways, and location-based logistics, Farm2U aims to enhance supply chain transparency and reduce food wastage. The platform also supports seasonal crop promotions, farmer profiles, and product traceability, empowering buyers to make informed choices about the food they purchase.\n\nThe primary goals of Farm2U are:\n\nTo improve farmer income by offering a fair trade marketplace.\n\nTo provide consumers with fresh, affordable, and traceable produce.\n\nTo create a sustainable and efficient agricultural supply chain.\n\nThis project addresses key challenges in the agri-business ecosystem, including supply chain inefficiency, lack of price transparency, and limited access to fresh produce in urban areas. Through a user-friendly mobile and web application, Farm2U envisions bridging the gap between farm and table, fostering trust, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.",

The core idea is to solve something we all face: scattered finances. We’re constantly juggling rent splits, UPI transfers, food expenses, part-time earnings—and there’s no app that feels built for this lifestyle. SplitwiseMe brings it all together, but with something extra: context-aware intelligence.  The app doesn’t just track what you spend—it learns how you spend. Using AI, we’ll suggest personalized budget plans, predict expense patterns, and even auto-categorize transactions based on previous behavior. You’ll get smart nudges—like “Hey, you’re spending more than usual on food this week” or “You’re close to your monthly limit, want to slow down?”",

This project pushed me to work with asynchronous requests, API integrations, and voice interaction flows, which gave me hands-on experience in architecting conversational AI systems. Apart from that, I’ve built full-stack web applications, explored RESTful APIs, and contributed to collaborative coding environments where debugging and version control were crucial. I love reading documentation, understanding the “why” behind the “how,” and improving code quality with each iteration. These experiences have not only shaped my technical skills but also taught me the value of problem-solving, clean architecture, and community-driven learning  all of which I’m excited to bring to open-source through GSSoC.",

    "project_description": "Sustainability is no longer an option—it’s a necessity. As consumers demand more eco-conscious choices, retailers must reimagine their operations to reduce waste, lower carbon footprints and create a more responsible supply chain. From sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging to energy-efficient store designs and AI-driven waste reduction, innovation is transforming how businesses operate while ensuring long-term environmental and economic benefits.\n\nWalmart is at the forefront of this shift, leveraging AI to optimize supply chains and minimize waste. Their collaboration with GreenPod Labs is revolutionizing the way fresh produce is stored and transported, extending shelf life and significantly reducing food waste. These AI-powered strategies are ensuring fresher products, less spoilage and a more efficient distribution process, setting a new standard for sustainability in retail. Read more here.\n\nBeyond food sustainability, retailers are embracing circular economy models, closed-loop recycling systems and smart energy management to reduce emissions and drive impact at scale. The future of retail is not just about selling products—it’s about creating a positive, lasting impact on the planet and society.\n\nThink of solutions that retail businesses can leverage to push the boundaries of sustainability. Can your ideas lead to innovations in green logistics, zero-waste supply chains, ethical sourcing or carbon-neutral retail operations? Think beyond today’s solutions and help shape a smarter, greener and more responsible future for retail.",
